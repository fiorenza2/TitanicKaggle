# Titanic Kaggle

This was my attempt at getting above 80% test accuracy, and by hook/crook I achieved it.

In retrospect this is too verbose, but the intention is good and I learnt a fair amount from this.

In terms of innovation, I thought I'd get good mileage with the left or right side indicator (which is derived through the parity of the cabin number) but alas this was not useful.
